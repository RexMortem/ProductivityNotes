In the modern world, there are many comforts. In the past, everything was a struggle - from dramatic changes in temperature to hunger and thirst, there were many physical challenges. 

While the change from the old to the modern world is generally positive, there are some benefits lost from the old world.

## 2% Rule

Easter suggests you should incorporate small challenges into your life and uses an example from a study where, if an escalator is available, only 2% of people will choose to take the stairs.

By being part of that 2%, you choose the harder action which leads to a long-term benefit. 
## Rites of Passage 

Tribes would have rites of passage (and seemingly these tribes created these independently of each other) which would guide members from one stage to another in their lives. 

The rite of passage would give them confidence and awareness of themselves - by knowing you completed the rite of passage, you know you can do hard things.

There is a modern equivalent called **Misogi** which is a very hard challenge to be undertaken once a year with two rules:
1) you should have a 50% chance of actually completing it
2) it shouldn't kill you

The ideal outcome is that you reach your edge in the Misogi but then push past and discover your new edge.
## Smartphone Usage

Smartphones can become a soothing device and prevent you from really reflecting and thinking for yourself - you can eliminate negative emotion by using your phone to submerge yourself in notifications and distractions.
