In the modern world, there are many comforts. In the past, everything was a struggle - from dramatic changes in temperature to hunger and thirst, there were many physical challenges. 

While the change from the old to the modern world is generally positive, there are some benefits lost from the old world.

## 2% Rule

Easter suggests you should incorporate small challenges into your life and uses an example from a study where, if an escalator is available, only 2% of people will choose to take the stairs.

By being part of that 2%, you choose the harder action which leads to a long-term benefit. 
## Rites of Passage 

Tribes would have rites of passage (and seemingly these tribes created these independently of each other) which would guide members from one stage to another in their lives. 

The rite of passage would give them confidence and awareness of themselves - by knowing you completed the rite of passage, you know you can do hard things.

There is a modern equivalent called **Misogi** which is a very hard challenge to be undertaken once a year with two rules:
1) it should be hard enough that there's a 50% chance of completing it
2) it shouldn't kill you

The ideal outcome is that you reach your edge in the Misogi but then push past and discover your new edge.
## Smartphone Usage

Smartphones can become a soothing device and prevent you from really reflecting and thinking for yourself - you can eliminate negative emotion by using your phone to submerge yourself in notifications and distractions.

Being **uncomfortable in silence** is also discussed - being stimulated is another form of comfort and people have become used to not tolerating boredom (however you can focus better and produce better results in silence). 
## Rucking

There's a theory that humans used to do **"persistence hunting"** which is a form of hunting where predators chase down prey for long periods of time until the prey exhausts itself - the idea is that humans are evolved to be better at regulating their temperature and also running long distances for this purpose. 

An extension of this idea is that humans were evolved to carry weight over long distances so that they can carry prey back to camps (and also carry hunting equipment); Easter believes that rucking has a lot of amazing benefits because it mimics this.

**To get started**, it's recommended to start with a very light weight to benchmark - many people in the military hate rucking because they had to start with a massive weight and therefore didn't progress sustainably. 

It's also recommended to not exceed a $\frac{1}{3}$ of your bodyweight in additional weight unless you're training for something - injury prevalence increases after this point. 

It's also good for people of all ages to ruck together since the weight can be varied per person and it brings all the benefits and bonding of walking.
